Tests

Once shared Rediska with you, we want to be sure it works well. To achieve this, we cover it with comprehensive number of unit tests.

We use PHPUnit testing library (installation: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/installation.html) and Zend Framework (http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/introduction.installation.html).

Before running the tests you need to setup environment: rename `config.ini-dist` to `config.ini` in tests folder and specify your rediska instances configuration. You don't have to specify 2nd instance with two servers, but some tests will be ignored in this case.

Warning: Data on both servers will be cleared!

To run tests use commands phpunit in tests folder or if you use Zend Studio click with right mouse button on `bootstrap.php` and pick `Run As.. -> PHPUnit Test`.
